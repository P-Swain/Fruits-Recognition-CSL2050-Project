A)developing PCA algorithm for dimension reduction:
    1)Image Import and Preprocessing:

        *Images are loaded in batches, resized, flattened, normalized, and labeled.

        *Results are cached to a .pkl file.

    2)Dimensionality Reduction with Incremental PCA:

        *Data is reduced to 2 or 3 dimensions.

        *If PCA results exist in cache, theyâ€™re loaded.

    3)2D & 3D Visualization:

        *2D scatter plots visualize PCA results using matplotlib.

        *3D plots show deeper data structure using mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.

    4)Clustering with KMeans:

        *After PCA, KMeans groups images into clusters (default: 136).

        *Clustering results are visualized in 3D space.
B)adding PCA variance explained plots to assess component contribution.
        *figured out that the 135 clustered i considered were wrong using re library to find unique fruit labels
        *adding other feature other than pixel intensity which i am using now, like hog,color histograms,i think i can also use cnn features from the intermediate level
C) Additional Feature Extraction Exploration
        *Other Features: In addition to pixel intensity, other features like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and color histograms were explored for better feature representation.

        *CNN Features: Plans are in place to use CNN features from intermediate layers to enhance the feature extraction process. This could potentially improve the clustering accuracy by using more sophisticated image representations.
